# portfolio_project

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating my own portfolio web page.
The requirements for the webpage were as follows:

- Use HTML structure & semantic tags
- Implement CSS styling
- Create hyperlinks (specifically tel and mailto)
- Add a form to the page
- Include an image of myself
- Upload at least 2 project images
- Deploy on GitHub pages

I decided to base the theme of my webpage off of the existing design language that I've used on my CV. This set a clear guidelines of fonts, colour palette and visual aesethics. 

I aimed to keep my webpage as simple and clean as possible. I implemented CSS Flexboc to ensure that my content sat inline. When attempting to use "display: inline;", the content was still displaying in a block order, hence why I had to use Flexbox.

The main issue that I struggled with was the navigation. I found it difficult to make the items span the width of the page, then once I had done so, I struggled to add padding to the sides of the nav. I realised I had accidentlaly set the width of the nav to 100%, removing this fixed the issue.

After I got the hang of things, I found I really enjoyed this assignment and could easily create layouts as I understood the behaviour of HTML and how it interacts with CSS.
